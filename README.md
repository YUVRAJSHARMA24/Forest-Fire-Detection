# Forest-Fire-Detection
Natural ecosystems and populated areas are both significantly at risk from forest fires, necessitating immediate and efficient mitigation measures. In response, this study introduces a novel approach that combines machine learning methods with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) to improve early detection and warning systems for forest fires. Our strategy entails setting up a network of sensor nodes across the forest to continually track important environmental factors including temperature, humidity, and smoke levels. A powerful machine learning algorithm that can differentiate between regular environmental fluctuations and the existence of a forest fire is then used to process the obtained data.
